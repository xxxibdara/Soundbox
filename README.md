# **Soundbox**
A music management system app

## Purpose of the project
Soundbox is a music player android app, developed with Android Studio, that will play, organize and manage songs owned by the users. 
Quickly and simply finding and playing music the user wants to listen to is its main goal, and creating clean and intuitiv UI with maxizing the aesthetics of app is our second goal. 
The purpose of this project is to learn and develop Agile methodology, technical android app development/design skills and DB design and implementation. 
Communication and teamwork skills were definitely improved, learnt how to effectively collaborate with other members in a large project using Git version control system with multiple developers.
