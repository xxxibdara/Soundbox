          <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
          <p align="left">Soundbox is a music player app. It will play, organize and manage songs owned by the users. Quickly and simply finding and playing music the user wants to listen to is its main goal.</p>
        	<h3>Users</h3>
		   <p align="left">This system is designed for those who want to simply listen to music with their mobile devices and manage the songs on their devices. It will allow these users to view and categorize their songs as they wish.</p>
		<p align="left">People who use this app have the capability to create, modify and delete custom playlists on the fly with any of their available songs. Playlists can be shuffled and customized to fit the users listening preferences. Based on that, users will receive recommended songs and listen  to it.</p>
		<p align="left">For artists whose songs are released on this app will be able to see the ratings from users since each song can be rated. And every song could be searched based on the song's attributes such as its names, artist, album or genre.</p>
		<p align="left">This app also provides the information about each album, song, artist etc. Users who are interested in a specific musician or a specific song could check this information.</p>
		<p>For people who are curious about how many times do they listen to a specific song, and how long do they spend on listening to music a day, this app tracks and organizes this data then provides it to users.</p>
			<h3>Value</h3>
			<p  align="left">The system is envisioned as an android app. The features and backend could later be extended to fit the Apple iPhone, and a web app.</p>
			<p align="left">‘Soundbox’ is valuable for people who want a highly organized music app, caring about the storages on their devices and need music everywhere every moment as long as they have their phone with them. Additionally, it is helpful for the producers to receive new and useful feedback and evaluation from listeners/app users. It is also adds a method for app developers to earn money from entertainment companies. Specifically, when the app recommends some songs to the users, it will choose songs based on users’ likes or listening histories, as well as paid promotions. So, if the companies want users listen to the songs released by them, they need to pay for this, and the developers will put their songs on the “recommendation list”.</p>
			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p align="left">The project will be considered successful if users prefer our app over other music management apps. Success will be measured using two methods: by receiving over 4.0/5.0 as an overall score from Google Play Reviews and via a survey that will be sent to all users every month to assess our user preference. For example, users would be able to take an online survey asking “which music app is most used”, and if our app gets a higher percentage than others, then the app will be considered successful.</p>

          <h2>Postmortem</h2>
          <p align="left">Throughout this project, we've made mistakes, had successes, and learnt quite a bit from each. Our iteration 2 retrospective hit on a very important one: Spreading out work, and not doing it all in the day before the deadline. We're by no means experts at that (And our commit history would keep us honest on that one), but we've certainly improved at leaving less of it until the last moments. </p>
		  <p align="left">Going hand-in-hand with that is the idea of accurate time estimates. After all, to plan the work accurately, the time estimates need to also be accurate, and we were rather on the mark with them (see the velocity chart for details). We obviously weren’t exact, but we were close enough that we’d consider it a success in our process.</p>
		  <p align="left">Near the beginning of the project, when we began writing tests, we realized that testing units in isolation was nigh impossible without very low coupling (and, of course, high cohesion helps as well). We were running into issues creating tests, and this forced us to fix the cohesion/coupling issues in our code. This taught us an interesting lesson in that good programming practices will make things easier, and often force other good programming practices as well. </p>
		<p align="left">We’ve also learnt quite a bit about the Android development ecosystem and environment. This is most evident in an early and quick switch to using Fragments for most things instead of Activities, as we quickly realized how unwieldy and untenable it would be to continue using Activities. Knowing what we know now about the Android ecosystem and library, if we were to start over again, we would structure and plan the project to better take advantage of and better fit into, said ecosystem/library. For example, handling permissions was initially done as a bit of a distal afterthought, without full knowledge of how it worked, and slowly, as we encountered errors, bugs, and missing cases, it worked its way more into the core and structure of the code. Now, doing it again, with our knowledge, we could start out with these sorts of things already in the core and structure of our plans.</p>
		<p align="left">Lastly, the team environment has given us insight into, and some skills to work in, an actual workplace scenario. We’ve had to trust other people, and more importantly, other people’s code. In a large project, you can’t understand every line of code, and even if you could, it would certainly not be the most efficient way to go about programming. So instead we’ve learned (or practiced) trusting interfaces, and the code that implements these interfaces, without fully understanding the underlying code. This allowed us all to be as productive as we could be, all writing separate components, and trusting that they would come together and function. Another outcome was far fewer halts and a more efficient process as we didn’t need to wait for other people to finish “Their piece”, because we had the interface definition, and could test it with a test double until the full implementation was complete. </p>
