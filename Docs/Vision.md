## Vision Statement

`Soundbox` is a music player app. It will play, organize and manage songs owned by the users. Quickly and simply finding and playing music the user wants to listen to is its main goal.

### Users
This system is designed for those who want to simply listen to music with their mobile devices and manage the songs on their devices. It will allow these users to view and categorize their songs as they wish.

People who use this app have the capability to create, modify and delete custom playlists on the fly with any of their available songs. Playlists can be shuffled and customized to fit the users listening preferences. Based on that, users will receive recommended songs and listen  to it.

For artists whose songs are released on this app will be able to see the ratings from users since each song can be rated. And every song could be searched based on the song's attributes such as its names, artist, album or genre.

This app also provides the information about each album, song, artist etc. Users who are interested in a specific musician or a specific song could check this information.

For people who are curious about how many times do they listen to a specific song, and how long do they spend on listening to music a day, this app tracks and organizes this data then provides it to users.

### Value
The system is envisioned as an android app. The features and backend could later be extended to fit the Apple iPhone, and a web app.

‘Soundbox’ is valuable for people who want a highly organized music app, caring about the storages on their devices and need music everywhere every moment as long as they have their phone with them. Additionally, it is helpful for the producers to receive new and useful feedback and evaluation from listeners/app users. It is also adds a method for app developers to earn money from entertainment companies. Specifically, when the app recommends some songs to the users, it will choose songs based on users’ likes or listening histories, as well as paid promotions. So, if the companies want users listen to the songs released by them, they need to pay for this, and the developers will put their songs on the “recommendation list”.

### Goal
The project will be considered successful if users prefer our app over other music management apps. Success will be measured using two methods: by receiving over 4.0/5.0 as an overall score from Google Play Reviews and via a survey that will be sent to all users every month to assess our user preference. For example, users would be able to take an online survey asking “which music app is most used”, and if our app gets a higher percentage than others, then the app will be considered successful.


~~The system will be considered successful if we get at least an A in the course.~~
